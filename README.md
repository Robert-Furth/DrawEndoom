# DrawEndoom

Ultra-simple wrapper around [DSDA-Doom](https://github.com/kraflab/dsda-doom/) that displays ENDOOM screens when it exits.

Only for Windows, since I can't be bothered to test it on Mac/Linux/Haiku/TempleOS.
Maybe when I'm bored -- it probably isn't very hard.

## Why?

'Cause DSDA-Doom's support for ENDOOM sucks (why'd they remove it to begin with?) and I like my ANSI artwork.
Also because it's been a while since I've done anything in C.

## How?

Compile it (you'll need SDL2), drop it into the DSDA-Doom folder, and run it instead of dsda-doom.exe.

## It doesn't work!

Does on my machine.
Feel free to open an issue, but no guarantees I'll actually get around to it.
